## General Info

React Modal exercise. Fake information about non existing employees are used to display data. Each team member has a card on its own. User can choose among the employees and then check the individual information about respective employee. Once user is on the modal, by previous and next buttons, user can scroll through all members. I particularly like this project since it was very beginning of my React journey and I have created the modal window on my own without any CSS libraries. Feel free to check it out!
